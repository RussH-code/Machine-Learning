In this notebook we are going to look at email classification. In machine learning lingo, **'Ham'** describes email that has real desirable content and not-spam, and **Spam** refers to those that are generally not desirable. To classify ham from spam, we are going to perform surpervised learning on some pre-labeled data.

We are going to look at several key concepts in text handling in machine learning, aka Natural Language Processing (NLP).
