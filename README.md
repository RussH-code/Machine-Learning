# Machine-Learning

In this notebook we are going to look at email classification. In machine learning lingo, **'Ham'** describes email that has real desirable content and not-spam, and **Spam** refers to those that are generally not desirable. To classify ham from spam, we are going to perform surpervised learning on some pre-labeled data. (Source: http://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/)

We are going to look at several key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the framework of machine learning to handle text data. 

## 1. Tokenization
This is usually an early step in NLP to break long strings of text into smaller chunks or words (tokens).

## 2. Normalization
In text handling, normalization refers to a series of steps to standardize words, such as converting to the same case, removing punctuation and expanding contractions. This reduces bias introduced due to similar words appearing in differenct forms.

## 3. Stemming
Stemming is the process of removing suffix to get the **stem** of a word.

Example: playing -> play, eating -> eat
